EbService generates kotlin code that enables
a type-safe way of using the Vert.x EventBus.
The generated code eliminates the need of guessing
which types are required by EventBus consumers and
which types are produced by them.

On top of that, the generated functions avoid
unnecessary serialization and deserialization by
making use of a special
[EventBus codec](https://dev.to/sip3/how-to-extend-vert-x-eventbus-api-to-save-on-serialization-3akf).

## Getting started
Imagine we have a service that can divide a
double by another double.

We might model this service as follows:
```kotlin
interface DivisionService {
  suspend fun divide(dividend: Double, divisor: Double): Division

  sealed interface Division {
    data class Success(val quotient: Double) : Division
    data class Error(val message: String) : Division
  }
}
```

Next, we need to annotate this interface as follows:
```kotlin
@EventBusService
interface DivisionService
```

This will generate two things
* An implementation of this service (`DivisionServiceImpl`) that translates function
  calls into EventBus requests.
* An extension function that allows you to handle those requests:
  ```kotlin
  fun DivisionServiceRequests.divide(
    vertx: Vertx
  ): Flow<EventBusServiceRequest<DivideParameters, Division>>
  ```

Since the function has two parameters, we need to wrap them in a container. This is handled automatically
via a generated data class (`DivideParameters`).

This service is fully implemented in the `example` module.

## Limitations

Due to the nature of Kotlin you need to be extra careful
when handling sealed class / interface hierarchies that
include `object` declarations as their identities will
vary on the sending and receiving end.

This means when using `when` expressions, you need to add
an otherwise unnecessary `is` to the objects:

```kotlin
when (response) {
    is SomeDataClass -> // â€¦
    is SomeObject -> // here we need is!
}
```

## Adding it to your project

Add the [JitPack repository](https://jitpack.io/#wowselim/eventbus-service) to your build script and include the
following dependencies:

```groovy
implementation 'com.github.wowselim.eventbus-service:eventbus-service-core:<latestVersion>'
ksp 'com.github.wowselim.eventbus-service:eventbus-service-codegen:<latestVersion>'
```

The latest version can be found in [releases](https://github.com/wowselim/eventbus-service/releases).

## Debugging

To debug the code generator, run the `kspKotlin` task in the following way to be able to attach the debugger:

```bash
./gradlew clean kspKotlin --no-daemon -Dorg.gradle.debug=true -Dkotlin.compiler.execution.strategy="in-process" -Dkotlin.daemon.jvm.options="-Xdebug,-Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket\,address=5005\,server=y\,suspend=n"
```
